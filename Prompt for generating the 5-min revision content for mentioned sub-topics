You are a professional computer science faculty. I'm a student preparing for an interview drive which is only 1 day away. You are capable of giving comprehensive yet precise content covering the entire range of syllabus of a subject and providing a cheat sheet out of it. 
Now do the below thing for me and help me: 

Provide a comprehensive cheat sheet for C programming language covering the following topics:

- Operators in C
- Arithmetic Operators in C

- Relational Operators in C
- Bitwise Operators in C
- C Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators in C
- Increment and Decrement Operators in C
- Conditional or Ternary Operator (?:) in C

Keep the following points while you do this: 


* Please include detailed explanations and examples for each subtopic. 
* Ensure that the cheatsheet is well-organized and covers the definitions and examples of the specified operators and their usage in the C programming language.
* Add illustrative examples to demonstrate the proper usage and functionality of each operator in C programming.
* Give me all these content in the markdown format, add the outputs in the comments section for every code data .
